{\small TA cascade lossy source coding problem with one encoder and
two decoders is considered. All variations of this problem are
studied by varying the availability of correlated side information
at the encoder/decoder(s).  the set of achievable rate-distortion
triples is characterized for three instances of this problem when
the encoder is interested in transmission of a memoryless equiprobable
binary source X subject to Hamming distortion and the side information
Y is an erased version of X.  }
